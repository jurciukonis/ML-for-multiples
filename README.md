# Machine Learning approache for extensions of the Standard Model with additional SU(2) multiplets.

The functions and networks, together with computational examples in Mathematica notebook files, for the paper "Applications of Machine Learning in Constraining Multi-Scalar Models".

- The Mathematica notebook for model with quadruplet ["Quadruplet.nb"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/ML-for-multiples/blob/main/Quadruplet.nb).

- The Mathematica notebook for model with sixplet ["Sixplet.nb"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/ML-for-multiples/blob/main/Sixplet.nb).

- For more information about the models and obtained results see refs. [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07897)] and [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05272)].
